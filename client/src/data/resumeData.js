  heroSummary:
    "I keep customer-facing, cloud-hosted systems fast, available, and observable. Three-plus years operating and building on AWS, Azure and GCP - from triaging live incidents across distributed microservices to shipping the backend services and automation that prevent the next one.",
  about:
    "Cloud Operations-focused software engineer with 3+ years of experience running secure, scalable, high-performing systems for customer-facing workloads. Comfortable across the full incident lifecycle - Linux administration, monitoring, alerting, triage, root cause analysis and SOP documentation - and equally comfortable writing the Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and Go behind backend services, automation scripts and diagnostic tooling. Experienced with AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, CloudWatch and Splunk, and used to working across engineering, product and support teams to raise uptime and cut MTTR.",
